*****				GLOBAL SETTINGS					******

/ AI is only allowed to propose AI_MAX_TRADES trades within a certain
/ amount of time to prevent swamping players with trades.  How many turns
/ should pass before the AI forgets a trade? (ie. how many players need
/ to roll dice)
TIME TO FORGET TRADE = 18

/ At most how many trades should an AI be allowed to make before having
/ to wait for trades to expire from time_forget_trade to 0? Cannot be
/ more than 20 (AI_MAX_TRADES). 
MAX TRADES = 1

/ This number indicates the probability of the AI proposing a trade
/ every TICK.  Hence should be around 0.005 or something of the sort. 
/ For AI Drone mode, should be set higher, perhaps 0.02 - 0.05.
PROPOSE TRADE PROBABILITY = 0.0015

/ This number indicates the probability of the AI proposing a trade
/ when it decides it desperately needs a monopoly.  
MONOPOLY TRADE PROBABILITY = 0.02

/ This number indicates the probability of an AI trying to give another
/ player a monopoly for cash.  This ocurrs only if the AI owns a monopoly,
/ there are other players with monopolies, and the AI does not have at 
/ least a minimum number of houses. 
PROPOSE MONOPOLY GIVE AWAY PROBABILITY = 0.02

/ This number indicates the maximum number of houses the
/ AI should have per square on all owned monopolies and still

TRADE COUNTER LIMIT = 1

/ What is the probability of the AI countering a proposed trade? 
/ Number between 1.0 and 0.0. 
PROBABILITY OF COUNTERING TRADE = 0.8

/ The following two numbers dictate how long an AI will pause,
/ to simulate thinking, before doing certain actions.  The numbers are
/ in seconds. If MINIMUM PAUSE FOR ACTION is set to 0, will not
/ wait.  Note: actual minimum time waited will vary by up to one 
/ second less.  Hence a value of 2 will result in waits between 1 - 2
/ seconds.  A value of 1 will result in 0 - 1 second waits.
MINIMUM PAUSE FOR ACTION = 3
MAXIMUM PAUSE FOR ACTION = 4

/ The following is a number, in seconds, of how long the AI should
/ wait before accepting/rejecting/countering a trade, allowing
/ other players to understand what the trade is about.
PAUSE WHEN CONSIDERING TRADE = 7

/ This number is how long, in milliseconds, will the AI wait before
/ becoming impatient with a player taking too long to roll the dice.
/ After this time, will send a message trying to coax the player to move. 
/ About  180000 (3 minutes) is probably right
PATIENCE = 220000

/ How far are we willing to go to stop someone from purchasing a monopoly
/ in an auction?  Note: the actual bid offered also depends on whether
/ we have a monopoly, and whether there are any other monopolies on the board.
MONOPOLY SUICIDE FACTOR = 0.8

/ How many trades from the same player on the same property will the AI 
/ consider before getting fed up?  After reaching this maximum, the AI
/ will be fed up with any trade containing this property coming from that
/ player.  This includes properties given as well as received in the trade.
/ Can be between 0 - 3, where 0 means the AI will never get fed up. 
NUMBER OF TIMES CONSIDER PROPERTY TRADE = 2

/ After how many turns (its own or anyone elses) will the AI forget
/ that a property has been traded once?  1 - 3 should be right. 
/ Remembering a property is traded is used to not allow a single 
/ person from constantly proposing a trade with the same property.
TURNS BEFORE FORGETTING PROPERTY WAS TRADED = 3

/ When fed up with a player proposing trades with the same properties, 
/ what is the minimum evaluation for the AI to accept the trade?
/ Perhaps 0.5 - 1.0 is the right value. 
MINIMUM EVALUATION IF FED UP = 2.0

/ The following settings are for level 1 (dumb) AI.

MONOPOLY WAR CASH MULTIPLIER = 0.08

/ The following is the number x in 1.0 / x^(liquid_assets/1000) when figuring out
/ how much is cash worth, taking into account that we have a lot of it or
/ just a bit. 
CASH LIQUID ASSETS DEPENDANCE = 1.15

/ This number indicates how important our chances of success are

/ and the next two are for 1,2 utils. 
CASH COW FACTORS = 1.0  1.2  1.4  1.8     1.0  1.2

/ This number indicates how important is the fact that we got a monopoly,
/ gave a monopoly, or traded properties that allow trades. Should be around
/ 3.0.
PROPERTY STRATEGIC FACTOR = 10.0

/ This number indicates what is the minimum evaluation value we should get
/ for which we will accept trades. Anywhere between -5 to 10 should be 
/ playable values, where at -5 the AI will take losses in a trade, while
/ 10 will make the AI not trade unless a substantial gain is proposed.
MINIMUM EVALUATION TRADE BENEFIT = -0.5

/ When the AI is 'giving' away a monopoly for cash to improve it's standings
/ against the other players, what is the minimum evaluation for it to be
/ acceptable for the AI to 'risk' giving a monopoly to a player who would
/ not otherwise get one? 
MINIMUM EVALUATION WHEN GIVING A MONOPOLY FOR CASH = 100.0

/ The following importance values are related to PROPERTY STRATEGIC FACTOR.

/ This number indicates how important a factor is the fact that
/ we received our first monopoly.  Should be around 70?. 
MONOPOLY RECEIVED IMPORTANCE = 5

/ This number indicates how important a factor is the fact that
/ we gave a monopoly for cash, without getting one back.
/ This case is used only after a monopoly trade, when the AI player
/ is willing to give away a monopoly for a lot of cash, improving
/ his odds of winning. 
GIVING MONOPOLY IMPORTANCE = 100.0

/ This number indicates how important a factor is the fact that
/ we the BALTIC monopoly. 
BALTIC RECEIVED IMPORTANCE = 3.0

/ This number indicates how important a factor is the fact that 
/ we received/gave a property that allows a group trade for monopolies. 
/ Should be around 10?. 
PROPERTY ALLOWS TRADE IMPORTANCE = 0.00

/ This number indicates how important a factor is the fact that 
/ we received/gave a property that allows a group trade for a monopoly,
/ even though player already has a group trade possibility. 
PROPERTY ALLOWS ANOTHER TRADE IMPORTANCE = 0.0

/ The following indicates how important is a property if the
/ player owns all the squares of the monopoly except for one,
/ and that one is unowned, unless it is boardwalk or baltic.
PROPERTY GIVEN WITH ONE UNOWNED IMPORTANCE = 0.20

/ The following indicates how important is a property if all other
/ squares in the monopoly are unowned (including Boardwalk or Baltic)
PROPERTY GIVEN WITH TWO UNOWNED IMPORTANCE = 0.00

/ The following indicates the importance of a railroad, above its
/ face value, depending on how many we have.  4 values - first is
/ if we own 1, 2nd if we own 2, and so on.  Perhaps 2,6,18,54?
RAILROAD IMPORTANCE FACTORS = 0.01 0.2 0.50 0.8

/ The following indicates the importance of a utility, above
/ its face value, depending on how many we have. 2 values - first
/ for 1 utility, 2nd for 2nd utility.
UTILITY IMPORTANCE FACTORS = 0.01 0.2

/ The following holds a list of importance values for the number of
/ monopolies for which the AI holds a veto.  Ie.  it is strategically
/ beneficial to contain at least one property from every (or almost
/ every) monopoly.  This ensures we are included in any monopoly trade,
/ as well as allowing us to block any monopoly trades harmful to us. 
/ A list of 9 values - where the player owns from 0 - 8 monopolies. 
/ Note: right now, BALTIC is not counted as a monopoly when computing
/ veto power.  Hence 7 should be the same as 8.  Also, allowing one
/ monopoly to be free over which we have no control does not allow a
/ monopoly trade, since no one would give someone a monopoly without
/ a monopoly in exchange. (at least, no one in their right mind.) Hence
/ 6 should be the same as 7. 
/ num. monopolies have veto over:   0    1    2    3    4    5    6    7    8
MONOPOLY VETO IMPORTANCE VALUES =   0    0    0    0    0    0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0

/ The following multiplier is used in evaluating property importance
/ changes in a trade.  If the player we are trading is losing
/ property importance points in the trade (for instance, is
/ giving up a cash cow for money), then we multiply the importance
/ change by this factor.  Basically, we want people to pay for
/ important properties, but we don't want to pay for getting them. 
/ This multiplier is not applied to importance values arrived from
/ monopolies. Should be between 0.5 - 1.0. 
NEGATIVE PROPERTY IMPORTANCE CHANGE MULTIPLIER FOR OPPONENTS = 1.0

/ After calculating the property importance deficit (ie. fact we
/ gave/got a monopoly, or a property that allows a trade), what is 
/ the lowest value so that we will consider counter proposing a trade?
/ Numbers between -15 - 5 are fine.
LOWEST PROPERTY STRAT FACTOR FOR COUNTER PROPOSAL = -25.0

/ When using WHAT TO TRADE (see below) to figure out how much cash to
/ offer or ask for depending on our evaluation of the player, what is the
/ lowest level to use when proposing a non-monopoly trade? (ie. what is
/ the most we are willing to sacrifice if the trade is not that important?)
MINIMUM NON-MONOPOLY ATTITUDE = -1.0

/ The following lists what the AI will give for a monopoly in a trade, depending 
/ on its attitude towards a player.  The cash factors are also used to determine
/ how much cash the AI will give/get in a trade.  The values are in the
/ following order:
/ 1. 0 if not to give a monopoly in return, 1 if to give worst monopoly,
/    2 if to give best monopoly.
/ 2. How many properties to give that will allow opponent to trade for a 
/    monopoly?  Ie. before getting this property, the opponent has no
/    trade opportunities to get a monopoly. After getting this property,
/    there is a possible trade where the opponent will get a monopoly.
/ 3. How many cash cows to give?
/ 4. How many junk properties to give? 
/ 5. After the optimal trade is found, where we calculated the most
/    cash we are willing to give, and the least cash we would accept,
/    what factor should we divide/multiply this number by?  Should not
/    be less than 1.0, since then we are offering trades we would not

/ is rejected, especially if a monopoly forming trade, will lower attiude.
/ Is a number between -1 and 1 representing the likelihood of trading (1 = 100%,
/ -1 = 0%.).  Also determines how good a trade we propose.  If attitude is
/ low, we are going to make more concessions (because player is unlikely to
/ trade) then if a player trades often. A number separated by spaces for each
/ player. Note: These are initial values for each token.
PLAYER ATTITUDE = 0.05 0.05 0.05 0.05 0.05 0.05 0.05 0.05

/ The following number (suggested to be 0.2), represents the 
/ attitude lost/gained towards an opponent when a trade proposed by
/ the AI is rejected or accepted. 
ATTITUDE LOST FOR REJECTING TRADE = 0.17

/ The following number indicates the change of attitude per evaluation
/ point when evaluating trades it did not propose or is simply observing 
/ (ie. the worse the trade, the more points lost.)
/ Suggested to be about 0.002. 
ATTITUDE LOST PER EVALUATION POINT WHEN OBSERVING = 0.0075

/ The following is a number that will be added/subtracted to each player_attitude
/ every turn.
ATTITUDE CHANGE PER TICK = 0.0025

/ This indicates what attitude the AI will have towards a player after a long

/ Minimum amount of liquid assets (besides housed monopolies) to have on hand. 
/ Will not buy anything if won't be left with this much cash.  However, if     
/ calculated expenses are greater than this number, will try to keep      
/ more.  
MINIMUM CASH ON HAND = 130

/ What strategy should the AI use when keeping cash?
/ 0 = always try to keep minimum amount, as above.
/ 1 = keep enough for expected rent, calculated with housed monopolies
/ 2 = keep enough for expected rent, calculated without housed monopolies
/ 3 = keep enough for expeceted rent without monopolies + highest rent
/     square
/ 4 = Use a variant of the above three.  Will keep enough for average

/     monopoly rent if:
/   	- The total sum of the rents from fully housed monopolies
/		  plus rents from all other owned properties is more than

/ between BUYING STAGE CASH MULTIPLIER and NO MONOPOLY STAGE CASH MULTIPLIER,
/ depending on how many monopoly properties are left to buy. (ie. the
/ fewer monopoly (non-cash cow) properties are left to buy, the closer
/ the multiplier is to NO MONOPOLY STAGE CASH MULTIPLIER.
BUYING STAGE CASH MULTIPLIER = 0.05

/ During AI_STAGE_NO_MONOPOLIES, how important is cash?  Cash losses 
/ some importance, and revenue becomes most important. Probably around 
/ 0.025 or 0.015. 
NO MONOPOLY STAGE CASH MULTIPLIER = 0.030

/ During AI_STAGE_MONOPOLIES_NOT_OWNED_ONE, how important is cash?
/ Liquid cash losses all importance. Precedence should be set at 
/ getting that monopoly. Probably around 0.01 is good. 
MONOPOLY EXISTS BUT NOT OWNER CASH MULTIPLIER = 0.025

/ During AI_STAGE_MONOPOLIES_OWN_ONE.  Suddenly cash becomes important to
/ survive a hit on opponent's monopoly & buying houses.  Probably around 0.02.
