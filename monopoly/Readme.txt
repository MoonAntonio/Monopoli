Welcome to Monopoly!

This file contains helpful information, late-breaking 
news and a description of certain functions which 
were not implemented when the On-Line Help features 
and manual were created.


Minimum System Requirements
---------------------------
Operating System: Windows 95
Processor: Pentium 166
Hard Drive Space: 50 MB
Ram: 32 MB
CD-ROM Drive: 8x
Graphics Adapter: SVGA Graphics Adapter, 1 MB, 
800x600 16 bit capable, DirectX 6.1 Compatible
Audio card: DirectX 6.1 Compatible
Peripherals: Keyboard, Mouse
Modem (optional): 14,400 baud
Serial Port (optional):	9,600 baud	


CHANGING LANGUAGES 

To change the language in which you are playing, 
re-install Monopoly in the desired language so that 
the language data files are copied to your hard drive.

VIDEO CARD CAPABILITY

Monopoly must be played on a video card capable of 
800x600 screen resolution at a bit depth setting of 
16 bits. The card and software drivers must be DirectX 
6.1 compatible. If you experience problems or difficulty 
with graphics, contact your card manufacturer for the 
latest documentation and drivers.

DISPLAY SETTINGS

To change your display settings, from the desktop, 
click the Start button/ select settings / select 
Control Panel / select Display / select the Settings 
tab. Adjust the color palette drop down box to make 
changes to the bit depth.  Adjust the desktop area 
slider bar to make changes to the desktop area.

DISK CAPACITY AND SWAPFILE SPACE

Monopoly requires a minimum hard drive space of 60MB.  
This is comprised of approximately 6 MB which is 
copied to your hard drive and another 50MB used as 
swap file space.

Regardless of your Monopoly installation choice 
('Minimum, Typical, Custom'), it is mandatory that 
you have at least 50MB free space on your hard drive 
before running the game. If disk space is low, you 
may experience crashing and/ or graphics drop outs.  
For best performance, ensure that you have at least 
50MB free space before launching Monopoly.

A swap file (virtual memory) is temporary storage 
space on your hard drive which programs use for 
temporary storage of data.  Monopoly will use this 
space when it is running, then it will free this 
space when the game is terminated.

To view swap file information, from the desktop, 
click the Start button / select Settings / select 
Control Panel / select System / select Performance 
tab / select Virtual Memory Button.  For best results, 
you should let Windows Manage the Virtual memory 
for you.

JOINING A NETWORK GAME

When you join a network game, your computer will 
pause until a dice roll by a human, or, if the game 
has not yet started, until the Player Select screen.  
Nothing will work, including chat, until that 
time.  If you are trying to take over from an AI, one 
thing to try is to hit ESC and then answer NO when 
asked to exit the game.  This may give you access to 
the file menu. As each player joins a game in 
progress there is often a long delay (1-2 minutes) 
while the game re-synchronizes itself. 

Also, when you join a network game, the display
options are set for optimum performance.  

DETERMINING YOUR IP ADDRESS

A Windows 95 user can determine his or her IP address 
by choosing Run from the Start menu and typing WINIPCFG 
as the program to run. A Windows NT user can determine 
his or her IP address by running IPConfig from the 
command line. If the user is connected to both a LAN 
and a dial-up Internet service provider (ISP), the 
computer can have two IP addresses and the correct one 
must be selected. Most dial-up ISPs assign a dynamic 
IP address that changes each time the user logs on.

SAVING THE GAME

You can only Save a game when it's your turn to roll 
and move.  Rolling to get out of jail does not count 
as a move.  The effect is that you cannot Save the 
game while in jail.
