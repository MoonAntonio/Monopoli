/ *					DRONE CONFIG FILE                                     *
/ *																		  *
/ *	   This file contains the settings for an AI drone game (ie. low      *
/ *   graphics, only AI running as fast as possible mode for testing.)    *
/ *   Entries in this file are made as follows:                           *
/ * 1) Comment lines start with / as the first character (no spaces)      *
/ * 2) Variable names, like PLAYER ATTITUDE, are not case sensitive.      *
/ *    However, the entire name, including the spaces, is required.       *
/ * 3) After a variable, = must be placed.								  *
/ * 4) Only spaces are considered white space characters (ie. will be	  *
/ *    ignored, except in actual variable names.)						  *
/ * 5) Return carriage can not be used to separate values. Only spaces.   *
/ * 6) Up to 7 numbers can follow an =. (note: only the first number will *
/ *    be used for most settings, and up to 6 for TOKENS PLAYING.         *

/ Which players are playing?  The numbers are the tokens of each player.
/ Order of these numbers dictates the order of the players.
TOKENS PLAYING = 0 4 2 1

/ Should the players be cycled every new game?
CYCLE PLAYERS = 1

/ At most, how many milliseconds should a game last?  Note that games may last
/ longer for the following reasons:
/   1) Balanced monopolies - players have net incomes that are about the same,
/      or not different enough to offest the $200 go square.  I've seen this
/      happen with one player having Park Place & Baltic, and the other
/      Connecticut and Pacific.  Both player's incomes were rising.
/   2) Someone is blocking a monopoly trade.  It could happen that a monopoly
/      trade is almost impossible to make since at least one player will see
/      his chances of winning lower. 
/  Note: Optimal time depends on the computer you are running on, and the
/  size of the graphics being displayed.  I found 40 seconds (40,000 ms) 
/  to work on a Pentium 200, with the window size decreased to almost nothing.
MAX GAME TIME = 40000

/ How many games to play?
NUMBER OF GAMES TO PLAY = 2000
