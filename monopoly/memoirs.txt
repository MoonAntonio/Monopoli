Monopoly 2000 Memoirs.


Note: The game workspace had to have optimization turned off - it would crash after awhile
  otherwise.  It may be in the shared code, so look for it right off the bat (release build).

Note: AI's respond to NOTIFY_ARE_YOU_THERE with a bid - get several bids before auction is open.  A special
  NOTIFY_NEW_HIGH_BID announces the start of bidding.

Note: AI once continued unmortgaging & remortgaging Electric co until insufficient cash to unmortgage - quite a few times, it did have places for houses if it could afford em.

Note: AI's in Raise money state can stall and never sell houses to raise money causing a game lockup.

Note: Report that Chance, ride on reading & pay double did not charge double (not sure I beleive it, not checking).

Note: Last player standing does not get the second last players properties included in their winning totals.
  Careful that they deserve em - looks like they might be in escrow, but it could be to the bank not the winner.
